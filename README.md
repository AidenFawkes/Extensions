# Extensions

Just trying to make web browser extensions

## 1. OnePopup

* This is an extension for Firefox
* This extension will display all the tabs that are open in the browser in the form of a list
* Once this extension works, the next update will have QR Code support. This can be scanned and the specified tab can be opened on the device the code was scanned in

### Load the extension in Firefox

1. Open Firefox browser and navigate to 'about:debugging'
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and from the file browser, choose 'Extensions/OnePopup/manifest.json'
